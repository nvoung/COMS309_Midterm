This is the Repository for Nathan Voung and Doyle Chism's work on our COMS3190 midterm project.

To Doyle Chism
I have implemented the basic template of what we need for the midterm project. I have made folders for your Boats and Jetskis. What you need to do is load in all the images that you have for them and then go to the json file that I have created named products and put in all the names of the products the prices and then link the images in the url. I have a infoUrl setup in the json file which you may see, I am planning on using this to link to the html for the individual product page that will be like when you click on a product on amazon.
